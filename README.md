# SudokuAng

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.
The project is intended to present a sudoku puzzle solvable via the user interface.  A method to automatically solve puzzles, to check if an input grid is a valid sudoku with a unique solution, and hopefully a method to draft and/or automatically generate sudoku puzzles may also be created.  Saving user records of completed puzzles may also be incorporated.

Project is to include Angular pipes, a router, authentication and route guards, API calls, CSS styling, tests using Jasmine and Protractor, this README needs to be styled using GIFs.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
